    <h3>Juicy beef and broccoli stir-fried to perfection</h3>
    <h3>This delicious dish will have your family coming back for seconds!</h3>

    <p>Beef and broccoli is a popular Chinese-American dish that typically 
        consists of stir-fried beef strips and broccoli florets in a savory
         brown sauce. The beef is usually marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, 
         cornstarch, and other seasonings to give it flavor and tenderness. 
         The broccoli is quickly blanched or stir-fried to retain its bright
          green color and crisp texture</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pound flank steak</li>
        <li>1/3 cup beef or chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Microwave the broccoli in a glass bowl covered with 
            plastic wrap (holes poked for ventilation), 
            about 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil,
             1 teaspoon cornstarch and baking soda. Slice the beef 
             against the grain into thin strips and add it to your 
             marinade. Let it sit for at least 20 minutes, 
             or as long as overnight in the refrigerator.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, stir together the stock, 
            rice wine, oyster sauce and remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch
             until the cornstarch is fully dissolved.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Heat a wok or large skillet on high heat and add the oil. 
            When a wisp of white smoke appears, toss the marinated beef
             and garlic into the pan. Cook for about 1 minute, 
             continually moving the beef so it browns on all sides but 
             is still rare. Once the beef is seared, add the broccoli 
             and cook for an additional minute. Stir in the sauce and 
             keep it all moving. Don't be afraid to scrape any bits off 
             the bottom of the pan before they start to burn. 
             Once the sauce has turned into a nice thick glaze, 
             about 1 minute, serve immediately.</li>
