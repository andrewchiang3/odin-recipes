    <p>Pineapple fried rice is a popular dish in Thai cuisine that combines the sweetness of 
        pineapple with the savory flavors of rice, vegetables, and protein. The dish typically 
        includes stir-fried rice with chunks of pineapple, vegetables such as bell peppers, 
        onions, and peas, and protein such as shrimp, chicken, or tofu.</p>

        <li>2 eggs, beaten with a dash of salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped green onions (about 1/2 bunch)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked and chilled brown rice*, preferably long-grain brown jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 to 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce or sriracha</li>
        <li>1 small lime, halved</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh cilantro leaves, torn into little pieces, for garnishing</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large wok, cast iron skillet or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat and place an empty
            serving bowl nearby. Once the pan is hot enough that a drop of water sizzles on contact, add 1 teaspoon oil.
            Pour in the eggs and cook, stirring frequently, until the eggs are scrambled and lightly set, about 30
            seconds to 1 minute. Transfer the eggs to the empty bowl. Wipe out the pan if necessary with a paper towel (be careful, it's hot!).
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and add the pineapple and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly,
            until the liquid has evaporated and the pineapple is caramelized on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.
            Then add the green onion and garlic. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds.
            Transfer the contents of the pan to your bowl of eggs.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the pan. Pour in the cashews and cook
            until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice to the pan and stir to combine. Cook until
            the rice is hot, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Pour the contents of the bowl back into the pan and stir to combine, breaking up the scrambled eggs with your spoon.
            Cook until the contents are warmed through, then remove the pan from heat. Add the tamari and chili garlic sauce, to taste.
            Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lime over the dish and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and set aside.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Slice the remaining 1/2 lime into 4 wedges. Transfer the stir-fry to individual serving bowls and
            garnish each bowl with a lime wedge and a light sprinkle of cilantro. Serve with bottles of tamari and
            chili garlic sauce or sriracha on the side, for those who might want to add more to their bowls.
        </li>
    </ol>
